  "s_synopsis": "The story of &quot;Love &amp; Destroy&quot; opens in the near future when an extraterrestrial entity known as &quot;Germ&quot; descended from the sky and began feeding off human stress, quickly spreading across Earth and leaving mass destruction in its wake. After a few decades, humanity developed measures to counter the invasion with &quot;Battle Pod&quot; technology. These weaponized mechs were equipped with &quot;S.E.E.D.&quot; (Synchronized Energy of Emotive Dynamics), a system relying on positive, sympathetic emotions to effectively utilize their offensive capabilities. This would be best accomplished when each human pilot established a romantic connection with a robotic, female navigator called a &quot;Q-Tron&quot;. After years of fighting, the plan ultimately proved unsuccessful and humanity was nearly wiped out. In a final attempt to salvage the planet&#039;s future, a scientist sends three Q-Trons, their Battle Pods, and an instructor back in time to present day Japan, just before the appearance of the Germ. It is there that they across the unnamed player character, a male highschooler whom they rescue when the Germ initiates its attack. He then joins them in defending the world against the alien threat.",
