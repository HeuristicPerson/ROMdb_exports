  "s_synopsis": "In 1834, in the small New England fishing village of Illsmouth, the distinguished British scientist Lord Boleskine lost his mind. After studying ancient manuscripts of evil repute, he had travelled to this place to observe the passing of Halley&#039;s comet. What he observed that night, however, turned him into a raving lunatic. Now, 76 years later, Halley&#039;s comet is coming back, and young reporter John T. Parker has travelled to Illsmouth to try to uncover the truth in Boleskine&#039;s wild claims, and see the comet for himself.",
