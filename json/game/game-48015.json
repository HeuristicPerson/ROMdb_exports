  "s_synopsis": "The game takes place in Autumn of AW 1282, about 2 years before the events of Phantasy Star II. The emergence of biomonsters was soon followed by a new class of warriors called hunters. Hunters devote themselves to protecting the people of Mota from attack. Anna Zirski, however, is a hunter of a different sort - one who hunts hunters, those who have gone rogue and become as much of a threat as the monsters themselves. This chapter details Anna&#039;s origin as a bounty hunter, and follows her chase for a wanted Motavian hacker. Her adventure in pursuit of this criminal leads her to find out about her target&#039;s remorseful past, inspiring her to renounce her bounty hunting career, and instead becoming a &quot;Counter Hunter&quot; - choosing to focus her efforts on hunters that have gone truly bad, rather than dutifully arresting anyone with a bounty on their head.
