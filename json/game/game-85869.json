  "s_synopsis": "Wreak havoc in the air when you lock on target and blast your enemies out of the skies. You are Jake Steel and it&#039;s up to you to stop a crazed madman from blowing up the United Nations. It&#039;s a tough job, but someone&#039;s got to do it.\r\nTo make your job a little easier, you get to choose your weapon of attack. You can choose from four different aircraft: the F14 Tomcat, the A10 Warthog, the British Tornado, or the Japanse FSX. Lock On delivers realistic air to air combat and you&#039;ll be pulling G&#039;s that you never even knew existed. The enemy forces on the ground are not immune to your fire power either. You can defeat enemies in the air and on the ground.",
