The first criminals in the wanted list can be stopped with your service weapon and some fast reactions, but once you&#039;re facing the toughest criminals in town you&#039;ll need to use the cyber suit, which provides additional protection and higher firepower. You start off as a normal cop but after completing 2 levels you get to join the ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics) division and gain access to their specialised armour.",
