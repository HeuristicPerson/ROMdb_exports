  "s_synopsis": "This was an ancient story when people still believed in witchcraft. There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn&#039;t want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.",
