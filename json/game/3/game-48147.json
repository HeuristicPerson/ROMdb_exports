By allowing a soldier to get captured, perhaps he could escape and single-handedly defeat the enemy forces in his way. In P.O.W., the player is a soldier who has been imprisoned in a Prisoner of War camp and must escape. In order to accomplish this, he must defeat a variety of enemies. The foes will attack you hand-to-hand, with knives, guns, and from helicopters. Boss enemies will guard the end of each level.",
