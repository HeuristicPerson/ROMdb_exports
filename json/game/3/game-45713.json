  "s_synopsis": "In 2019, Manhattan has been expanded by an artificial Island called Zenovia, owned by GiganTech Cybertronics Corporation. While GiganTech claimed this to be a new safe place in regard to the the rest of crime-infested future Manhattan, in reality crime grew even more so on Zenovia, to the point where it became a slum except for the GiganTech headquarters. Even worse, government investigations revealed that GiganTech itself is one of the biggest organized crime syndicates, testing their robotic weaponry on Zenovia to become the sole power of the underworld. Government authority is too weak against the mechanical forces that GiganTech commands, therefore nine fighters called &quot;Zero-Cops&quot; - three police, three convicts, and three psychics - have been drafted to invade Zenovia, riding Batrider called airbikes .",
