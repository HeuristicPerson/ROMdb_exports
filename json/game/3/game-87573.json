But now with the advent of more technically sophisticated weapons, the evil &quot;Fulvar&quot; and his &quot;Seven Star Alliance&quot; have returned to destroy all planets that stand in their way of the ultimate target... Earth! Now in the year of 2525! Your mission as pilot of the new SYD-FX fighter is to use every weapon at your disposal to rid the galaxy once and for all of the evil that now dominates and threatens Earth. So suit up, hold your breath, and stand ready for unbelievable graphics and stereo sound that&#039;ll suck you into the far reaches of deep, dark inner space.
