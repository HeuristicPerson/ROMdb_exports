Past and future worlds, black magic, hidden traps - take your sword with a lot of courage and never throw a glance back. Four elements from the 20th century have entered the world of Camelot: &quot;The voice of another world&quot;, &quot;Wisdom mirror&quot;, &quot;The life elixir&quot; and &quot;The fire that doesn&#039;t burn&quot;. You must take them and present them to the guardians of each world, who will be in charge of their destruction.",
