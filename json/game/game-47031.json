  "s_synopsis": "The year is 2219AD, and Earth&#039;s Star Federation has unleashed the R-GRAY advanced tactical combat fighter to save the planet from certain destruction at the hands of the bloodthirsty Secilia Federation. Despite impossible odds, you must now command a specially outfitted R-Gray fighter to defend Earth from certain destruction. Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasters, pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy all sighted targets as once. Even with this technology at your disposal, the battle will not be easy. Earth&#039;s forces are depleted, and the merciless hordes of Secilia will settle for nothing less than complete annihilation of Earth. Fortunately, Star command has created two R-GRAY prototypes, so if you need extra firepower, a skilled friend can fly at your side.",
