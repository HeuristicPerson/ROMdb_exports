  "s_synopsis": "The greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you&#039;re not backing down, because you&#039;re Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who&#039;s come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies. But wasting these slimeballs won&#039;t be easy. Because they&#039;ll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We&#039;re talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They&#039;re hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!",
