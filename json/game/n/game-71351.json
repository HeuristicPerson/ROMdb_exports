He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty&#039;s Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.",
