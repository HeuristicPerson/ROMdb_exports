Continuing right after the events of God of War II, Kratos, the fallen god and spartan warrior, finds himself riding on the back of the Titan Gaia toward Mt. Olympus. Betrayed and killed by his father and ruler of Olympus, Zeus, to give up his power, Kratos returns from the Underworld and decides that he will bring about the death of Zeus by any means necessary. Knowing that the battle against the Olympians would not be easy, he enlists the help of the Titans, the former Elder Gods overthrown by Zeus and his brothers, to help exact revenge. With nothing much to live for, Kratos will stop at nothing to bring chaos to all of Olympus.",
