  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Evander Holyfield&#039;s &#039;Real Deal&#039; Boxing&quot; is a boxing simulation. Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. The developers went for a more strategic simulation. The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.",
