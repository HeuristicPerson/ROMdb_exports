  "s_synopsis": "A little boy likes to play video games. Day and night he sits in front of his GameStation and plays a game called Moon: a typical Japanese RPG with a sword-wielding hero who kills monster after monster on his grand epic quest. Skipping through the boring, cliche story, the boy continues to play until his mother tells him to stop and go to bed. However, the TV on which he was just playing the game miraculously turns itself on, and the boy is sucked into the world of Moon, a fantasy land called Love-de-Gard. It turns out that the hero of the game that the boy was playing is a troublesome individual, who does nothing else but slaughter various creatures populating the land, barge into people&#039;s houses bothering them with questions and taking their possessions without asking, and complain that he &quot;can&#039;t reach the final dungeon&quot;. Souls of the animals the hero has killed find no rest, and the land&#039;s inhabitants are horrified. The boy realizes that there can only be one answer to that: love.",
