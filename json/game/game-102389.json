  "s_synopsis": "You know what it&#039;s all about. That&#039;s right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. It doesn&#039;t get rougher or tougher than the streets of L.A., where Riggs and Murtaugh take on every cheap low-life mercenary, street punk and dope dealer to get to the real slime behind big-time corruption. How much of your life, your future, are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Who&#039;s the best man for each of your three missions? Remember, you&#039;ll have to use your muscle and your wits. You decide. And do it carefully!",
