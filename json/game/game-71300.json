  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Metal Mutant&quot; is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7. Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You&#039;ll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. ",
