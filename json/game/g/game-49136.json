  "s_synopsis": "Set in World War II, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams. This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won&#039;t be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.",
