  "s_synopsis": "A newly established, yakuza-backed factory enforces a nefarious grip on Kunio&#039;s town. People that try to do anything about it disappear and gangs rule the streets, but when the main baddass Yuji kidnaps beautiful Miho from Nekketsu high the line is crossed. Now Kunio (with the optional help of his pal Riki in 2 player gameplay) heads to the factory across town to get Miho back and provide a sound beating to Yuji and anyone that gets in the way.",
