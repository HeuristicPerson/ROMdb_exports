  "s_synopsis": "As Ben E. Factor himself, you must travel through the six moons of Minniat, on which the peaceful and good-natured people of Lullyat have been kidnapped. These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.",
