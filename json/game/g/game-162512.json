  "s_synopsis": "Saren and the Sovereign have been defeated and the Citadel has been saved. Depending on the player&#039;s choices made in the first Mass Effect, humanity may be all that&#039;s left of the Citadel Council. Of course, that doesn&#039;t keep them from ignoring the former war-hero Shepard who knows that the threat from the Reapers is still real. Instead, they send him or her on a boring mission to find some Geth in the Terminus system. The inevitable happens: a new enemy enters the scene, destroys Shepard&#039;s ship, the Normandy, and kills the hero of the galaxy. End of game? No, not really. Cerberus, a known human-centric network, believes the threat from the Reapers to be real and only sees one chance of saving the human race: Shepard. So they invest millions upon millions of credits into the Lazarus Project, and two years after Shepard died floating in space, he/she reawakens on-board the Cerberus Station. The main mission is given by Cerberus: find out more about the mysterious race of Collectors who abduct millions of human colonists for an unknown purpose, and figure out their possible connection to the Reapers.",
