  "s_synopsis": "The player assumes the role of a pilot whose mission is to actually survive an eight years long training mission, where he is supposed to prove his worth as a fighter and gain entry to the future elite squadron known as the DonPachi Squadron - which is featured prominently throughout the entire series. The twist lies in the fact that the enemies are, in truth, the player&#039;s very own comrades, posing as enemies and sacrificing their lives for the sake of allowing only the most skilled pilots to pass the test, and survive.",
