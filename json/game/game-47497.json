  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; continues the story directly from where &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; left off. The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island&#039;s Mushroom Hills. Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power. Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik&#039;s plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles? Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he&#039;s attacked by one of Robotnik&#039;s robots! He quickly begins a chase for revenge.",
