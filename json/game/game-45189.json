  "s_synopsis": "From various time periods of past, present and future, nine fighters killed in an unjust manner find themselves given a second chance for life. An alien being, known only as the Eternal Champion, brings back the fighters into a competition for one reason: to find one among them worthy of being resurrected, giving them a chance to avert their death and tip the balance between good and evil. The fighters range from different eras of Earth&#039;s History: Larcen, the cat burglar. Jetta, the circus acrobat. Blade, the futuristic bounty hunter. Midknight, the vampiric bio-chemist. Rax, the cyborg. Shadow, the corporate assassin. Slash, the neanderthal. Trident, a Atlantean warrior. And Xavier, a warlock and alchemist.\r\n",
