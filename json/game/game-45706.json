  "s_synopsis": "Gigantic change of pace from most other shooters. Rather than taking the role of spaceships or other similar vehicles, you control one of three espers - that is, humans with extra sensory powers - who have the ability to fly and shoot lasers from their hands. It&#039;s set in futuristic Tokyo in the year 2018, as powerful psychic Mrs. Gara and her goons, The Yaksa, plan on taking over the world. Mrs. Gara has amassed an army of tanks, psychic soldiers, robots, and even clones to remove any opposition by force. The setting takes the characters over school yards, city streets, malls and parks - a definite shift from the usual military installations and so forth - which, combined with the whole flying humans thing, gives it a very unique feel, even though it&#039;s not functionally much different from other danmaku shooters.",
