  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Mad Mix Game&quot; is a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; variant, with a typical bird&#039;s eye view for each level and pellets you must eat in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you&#039;re trapped in and gobble up food while trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you. Some levels offer transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from a fixed vantage point.",
