  "s_synopsis": "You live in a place of peace and harmony called the Magic Kingdom. The Magic Kingdom consists of seven worlds: the enchanted forest, mountains, swamps, cursed cliffs, and the palace of the evil wizard, Necroman. From the dawn of time, the peace within the seven worlds of the kingdom was controlled by a line of very good and very powerful magicians. It was one of these magicians who was chosen to inherit the power of his ancestors and thus became the guardian of the strange Book of Sorcery, which enabled him to hold absolute power in his hands. Alas, the peace of the kingdom was not to last as in the shadows, dark forces under the control of Necroman stole the Book of Sorcery and kidnapped the guardian magician. The kingdom fell under the control of the evil Necroman and from that day forward, green devils, wicked genies, and other demons have haunted the once beautiful and peaceful kingdom. ",
