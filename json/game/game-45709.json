My partners are Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine. We&#039;re bounty hunters. So this is what you&#039;ll be doin&#039;. When there&#039;s a bounty to be had, we&#039;ll be flyin&#039; out to catch it. For that purpose, we&#039;ve got ourselves a couple of small fighting ships: my Hammerhead, Spike&#039;s Swordfish II, and our Redtail. We&#039;ll give you one of them to try out, but you&#039;d better damn well take care of it. Get out there, catch a few bounties, and perhaps we can eat something for dinner other than bell peppers and beef, minus the beef...\r\n",
