  "s_synopsis": "You&#039;ve gotta have a gimmick! Prepare to meet your destiny. And put all your game playing skills to the test. Mr. Gimmick is a mystical, exhilarating, and very dangerous adventure that begins where all other games have ended. Violent enemies that suddenly become your ally, if you know the secret. Magical items hidden away in secret places that ensure your survival if you find them and prevent you from even finishing the game if you don&#039;t. Mr. Gimmick&#039;s only weapon is a cosmic star with a potent form of energy you must harness. Master it, and the star can cripple your enemies, carry you over dangerous territory, and enable you to reach levels - and hidden places - that are unattainable to anyone but an expert. Every game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You&#039;ll call on many skills, techniques, and tricks you&#039;ve learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive this evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive. And only the very best will experience the secret ending.",
