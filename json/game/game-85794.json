  "s_synopsis": "Enjoy a breathtaking weekend on us, in 500 B.C. Greece. Shien&#039;s Revenge takes you warping through time to places like 21st centry South America and 13th century Mongolia. Sounds like one heck of a vacation doesn&#039;t it? And the only thing that might put a damper on your travel plans is Saw Tooth, master of evil ninja techniques, because he tends to destroy everything in sight. Oh, and there are the Hanging Snakes that live in treetops and drop down when they&#039;re hungry. And did we forget to mention the Undertake, whose expertise lies underground.",
