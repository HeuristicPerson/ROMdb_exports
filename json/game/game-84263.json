The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician&#039;s apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever?",
