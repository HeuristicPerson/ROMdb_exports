Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it&#039;s just a book, isn&#039;t it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you&#039;re here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.",
