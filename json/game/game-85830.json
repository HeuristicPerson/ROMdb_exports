  "s_synopsis": "Freedom is everything. You are Rambo. Fallen hero. Once a decorated green beret; special weapons expert; master of the martial arts. Now, you&#039;re living in solitary, a prisoner of the government you swore to defend. Intelligence sources believe they have discovered a hidden POW camp deep in the jungle. Your brothers in arms have been enslaved there for years. It&#039;s your choice: accept a suicide mission to find the camp, or spend the rest of your life in a 6&#039; by 8&#039; cell. Your body is a weapon. Your mind, a disciplined machine. The most advanced military hardware is at your disposal, and a chopper waits to carry you to the drop site, where once again, you will be alone deep in hostile territory. This is your war, Rambo. A war that will test your every skill. A war with only two possible results: freedom or death. Armed and alone, you parachute into enemy territory. Match courage and wits with the animals that rule the jungle. Race to the landing site. It may be your only way to escape. Weave your way through the enemy weapons warehouse.",
