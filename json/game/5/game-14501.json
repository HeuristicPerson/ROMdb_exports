  "s_synopsis": "You control Aladdin through locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar&#039;s palace. Some locations not appearing in the film include a trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie&#039;s lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in Aladdin&#039;s way include the Sultan&#039;s guards, animals and various magical creatures. They can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or by throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and throwing, another one of Aladdin&#039;s abilities consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it to slow his fall.",
