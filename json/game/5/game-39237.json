It is said that a person can turn into a dragon by piercing his own heart with this dagger. When one of the emperors used it for that purpose, Tibetan monks manage to withdraw the dagger from his heart and return it to its resting place on the Great Wall. While investigating the legend, the archaeologist Lara Croft finds out that a powerful Venetian crime lord is hunting for the dagger, and must do everything in her power to prevent him from obtaining it.",
