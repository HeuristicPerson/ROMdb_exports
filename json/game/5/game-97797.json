And the place is crawling with them. These vicious, vile parasites have even managed to confiscate the casket of the late great Queen Cynthia. It&#039;s your job to exterminate these treacherous creatures. To return the casket to its hallowed tomb. And save the colony from certain collapse. You&#039;ll have special equipment to help you along the way. Like a supersonic jet engine, a special bomb, missiles and a magic key. But time is running out. So don&#039;t just stand there thinking about it. Get on it. And get rid of this gruesome group. For good!",
