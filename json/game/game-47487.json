  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Gynoug&quot; is a horror-themed shoot&#039;em up similar to &quot;Thunder Force&quot; and other horizontal shooters. But other than most of them where you play a spaceship of some sort, here you play as Wor, a member of the so-called &quot;Flying men&quot; who look quite similar to angels. The home planet of these people, Iccus, has been taken over by a virus that has mutated into a collection of quite horrible creatures, and every previous attempt to battle them has failed. So now it is Wor&#039;s turn to save his home planet and destroy these mutants once and for all!",
