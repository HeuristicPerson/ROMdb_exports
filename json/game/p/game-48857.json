The player must complete laps around the race track before a timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player&#039;s time as he passes. Race Drivin&#039; has three courses, one of which is the track from Hard Drivin&#039;. There is a new super-stunt track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.",
