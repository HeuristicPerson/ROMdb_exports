  "s_synopsis": "This Game&#039;s So Intense, Everything Else Is Unnecessary. On any given Sunday, it comes down to one thing: You against the other guy, strength against strength. It&#039;s power football and you don&#039;t go half way. You&#039;ll pound the middle with backs like Barry Foster and Jerome Bettis. Stuff the run with guys like Reggie White and Junior Seau. Take Sterling Sharpe and Rod Woodson one-on-one with Tim Brown. You&#039;ll spread &#039;em out with multiple offensive and defensive sets, shut &#039;em down with all-out blitzes and custom audible calls. In this game, you&#039;ll play through blind-side sacks, goal line leaps and hits so intense, you&#039;ll wonder if it&#039;s worth the punishment. But any pro will tell you, the only thing that&#039;s unnecessary is losing.",
