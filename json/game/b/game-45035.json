  "s_synopsis": "Many years ago, the dark lord Sauron forged the One Ring to control the races of the Middle Earth. He was defeated by the human prince Isildur, who took the ring to himself. But such was the evil power of the ring that it brought misfortune to whoever dared to bear it, corrupting their souls. Eventually, the ring ended up by Frodo Baggins, a peaceful hobbit who was unaware of his possession&#039;s true nature. Realizing that the only way to be free of the ring&#039;s power would be to destroy it, the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to carry it to Sauron&#039;s land, Mordor, and throw it into the lava rivers of the Orodruin volcano, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.
