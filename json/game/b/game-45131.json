They want to sell it to the government&#039;s department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.\r\n",
