  "s_synopsis": "It&#039;s Dr. Mario for an intense new challenge! Mario throws multi-shaded vitamin capsules into a bottle that contains an ugly variety of nasty viruses. You can move, shift or spin the capsules as they fall. Arrange them to align with other capsules on top of a virus. If you can get 4 or more of the same shade in a row, POOF! They disappear! Destroy all of the viruses in the bottle and you progress to the next round where things get even more difficult.",
