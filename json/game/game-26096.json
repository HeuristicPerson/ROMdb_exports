  "s_synopsis": "A twinkling consciousness became a star that sparkled in the night and banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into the light of that sun. She made Fa&#039;Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one.\r\n\r\nIn Legend of Mana the player controls a hero or heroine traveling over the land of Fa&#039;Diel. The game features a land creation system, allowing the player to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land&#039;s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, the player will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. It is also possible raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments.",
