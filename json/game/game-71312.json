  "s_synopsis": "Roger Wilco is one of the most important men on the starship Arcada: he is the janitor! Just when he was doing what he does best (dozing off in a closet), the shrill sound of an alarm penetrated the air. Arcada is attacked by the evil Sariens! Before Roger realizes what is going on, he discovers that he is the only survivor. The Sariens have killed the entire crew and stolen the valuable Star Generator. Roger&#039;s immediate task is to find a way to leave Arcada, which is about to explode in fifteen minutes. And then he&#039;ll have to show the Sariens why they should never mess with brave intergalactic janitors!",
