  "s_synopsis": "Following genetic experiments conducted by a group of scientists at the turn of the millennium, a biological explosion contaminated the genetic structure of life on Earth. Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.",
