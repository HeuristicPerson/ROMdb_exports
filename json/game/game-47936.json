  "s_synopsis": "You are an allied fighter pilot in WW1, duking it out with the &quot;Huns&quot; up in the sky in over 200 missions. The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.",
