Black elves and orcs became his minions. The gods flooded the land in response, secluding the island kingdom of Arborea as the last stronghold against Mogroth&#039;s forces. Jarel, the last Prince of the elf-like race of Sham-nirs, must find allies who would help him on his quest to obtain four elemental crystals, restore the power of the temples, and defeat Mogroth.",
