  "s_synopsis": "Trash the surf board and heave the &#039;za. It&#039;s a whole new breed of Turtles and they&#039;re fixated on fighting. We&#039;re dead serious, Tournament Fighters takes dude-on-dude demolition to new heights of intensity with 4 modes of pain-producing battles, deadly warriors, secret arenas, astounding graphics and sound effects that&#039;ll make you cringe! Clash with Krang-created clones of the Turtles, Casey Jones, April O&#039;Neil, Ray Filet and Sisyphus, plus bosses Triceraton, Krang&#039;s Android and Karai. There&#039;s flying body presses, knee drops, head butts, rocket punches, elbow smashes, somersault throws, you&#039;ll feel and inflict them all. And the settings include Magma Ocean Planet, Jungle Planet, and every other bizarre corner of Dimension X!",
