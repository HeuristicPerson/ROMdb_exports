  "s_synopsis": "As with the original Brutal: Paws of Fury, the game involves a martial arts tournament set up by the Dalai Llama. A selection of 12 anthropomorphic animals are involved; choose from them for the cartoon-styled beat &#039;em up action. Characters each have their own fighting style, array of moves, and storyline. As you progress through the game, you unlock more moves for each character. There&#039;s also a progressive conquest mode which challenges you to take over the entire Brutal Island.",
