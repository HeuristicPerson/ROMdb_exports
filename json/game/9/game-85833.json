  "s_synopsis": "The Northstar space station has been overrun by aliens, with all reports suggesting that the crew didn&#039;t survive. It&#039;s your job to progress through its floors, wipe out the aliens and restore order. What this entails is essentially a case of walking from left to right taking out everything you see. You are armed with a lance, which you can use from some distance, although you can only attack in one direction at a time, although aliens can come at you from all around, many of them using some wicked patterns. There are ledges to be climbed; the lance can be used to hoist your way up.",
