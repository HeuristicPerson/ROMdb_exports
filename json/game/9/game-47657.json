  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Thracia 776&quot; continues the Fire Emblem story with a midquel or a &quot;meanwhile&quot; setting. The events transpire during Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu and the game contains many of the same characters from that game, while featuring cameos of many more. At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster&#039;s struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.",
