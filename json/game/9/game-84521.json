But then, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that turns the city into rubble, wipes out the population, and results in the city&#039;s air defense grid in the control of a massive terrorist force. There is only one option left, a behind-the-lines assault by a Bionic Commando.",
