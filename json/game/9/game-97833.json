  "s_synopsis": "Long time ago, the Gods fought the Demons in a cosmic battle. To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the &quot;Evil Holy Sword&quot; Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven. Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it&#039;s time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world.",
