  "s_synopsis": "Choose one of several characters to play with, each with their own unique moves and special attacks. Each stage in the game has two battles, where the object of each is to drain your opponent&#039;s energy in order to complete the battle, and you will complete the stage if you do this twice. If there is a draw, then a third battle is played. There is a time limit, and when this expires, the player with more energy left wins.",
