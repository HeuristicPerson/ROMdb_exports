  "s_synopsis": "Fourth game in the Arkanoid series. It is largely similar to its predecessor &quot;Arkanoid: Doh It Again&quot; as it has the same power-ups (plus the Giga-Ball) and board size. Some of the level designs have even been reused. The game has 50 levels, and the theme changes every 9 levels. Unlike past games, it doesn&#039;t have any boss battles.",
