But one day their enemy, the evil Pitark, attacked with his many hordes, leaving the Skweek defensless. Many years later Pitark died and the Skweek decided the time had finally come to decontaminate the 99 continents of Skweekland, thus reverting themselves to their original color of pink. It is Skweek who now has to accomplish this difficult and dangerous mission. If Skweek can succeed in painting all of the continents pink, then Skweekland will once again become a free and prosperous planet. So help him out, he needs you!",
