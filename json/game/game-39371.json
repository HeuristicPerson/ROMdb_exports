  "s_synopsis": "Combat School is a slight twist on the sports game genre. The player is in a military boot camp, and needs to pass a variety of training exercises so that they can eventually complete important missions. Some of the events they&#039;ll compete in are the obstacle course, firing ranges, iron man race, arm wrestling, and a fight with their instructor. Gameplay is similar to that of the Epyx Games series, with many unique events that must be completed to move on. Two players can play simultaneously, or one player against the computer.",
