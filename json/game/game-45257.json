  "s_synopsis": "An ordinary average earthworm named Jim goes about his normal daily life, cruising around avoiding crows and doing other general worm-like things. Until one day, Jim is suddenly struck by a very large Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim&#039;s soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place. Jim soon realizes that he is now in control of the suit.",
