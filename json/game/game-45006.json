  "s_synopsis": "In Knight Force, the land Belloth, crossroad between five time periods, was conquered by the evil wizard Red Sabbath. And if that is not enough, he also kidnapped the princess. The player takes the role of a knight who has to set things right. To do so, he needs to complete five levels which represent different time periods. The goal is not only to destroy the wizard clone which occupies the time period, but also to collect seven talismans which are in possession of the wizard&#039;s minions. Each collected talisman brings advantages to the hero but only work in the correct time period which may not correspond with the one it is found in.",
