But with time, the queen&#039;s power fades, and a new queen must replace her. Several candidates compete until one of them proves that she has the knowledge of the nine elements and has convinced the Guardians to lend their power to her. The heroine of the game is a seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to befriend the Guardians and become the next queen?",
