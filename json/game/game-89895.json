  "s_synopsis": "As the game starts a struggle for total control over elemental powers is about to begin between two warring nations. As the best mecha pilot in the good guy&#039;s army it&#039;s your task to repel the invasion and win the war by dealing with the enemy armada in standard shooter fashion. But surprise surprise! You won&#039;t be alone this time, as other AI-controlled mecha pilots will join you in the fray at key moments. Only you can command the magical powers that can be added to your mecha by collecting several color-coded orbs though, so most of the fight is still going to be up to you.",
