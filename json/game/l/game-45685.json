  "s_synopsis": "You control a small car running around in a maze. What you have to is to pick up the ten green flags to get more points. While you try to collect the flags you are chased by hostile cars that try to crash your car. So dodge them by using your smoke screen. Other factors to take into account are a time limit, fuel gauge and that some roads are blocked by an rock! The right bottom corner of the screen shows a radar map that shows your position, the location of the hostile cars and the position of the flags. Not shown on the map are the special red flags marked with an S. Collect those for bonus points.",
