  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Columns&quot; is loosely derived from &quot;Tetris&quot;, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in &quot;Columns&quot; they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &quot;combos&quot; - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.",
