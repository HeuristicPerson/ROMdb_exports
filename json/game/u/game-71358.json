  "s_synopsis": "n her quest for power and revenge, the witch Scotia accidentally set into motion the revival of Belial, God of Evil. With her dying breath, Scotia gave her son Luther her mighty powers of shapeshifting, but through an error Luther received the powers in a damaged form: he cannot control when he changes or what he changes into. Things aren&#039;t easy for Luther: not only is he cursed with his mother&#039;s power, but the people of the Lands are understandably upset with Scotia and will attempt to take their frustration out on her son. With his mother&#039;s magic and a little help from the Draracle, an ancient being watching for signs of Belial&#039;s resurrection, Luther must find a cure for his curse and eventually stop Belial.",
