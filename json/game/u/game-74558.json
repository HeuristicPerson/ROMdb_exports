Gaya looked over his five masters of magic and spoke: &quot;The time has come to choose a new king, but only one of you will reign. You will use your magical powers to create fighting monsters and ultimately you will live or die. Whoever remains will conquer and inherit my kingdom. Though you may win or lose, each of you must fight to the end to be worthy of ruling my kingdom.&quot; After Gaya spoke, he pointed to a door behind the five masters of magic. &quot;On the other side of the door, I have created a world of the Master of Monsters,&quot; roared King Gaya. &quot;Go and fight to your victory!&quot; ",
