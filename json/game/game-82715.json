  "s_synopsis": "He&#039;s totally new. Totally tough. And he&#039;ll stop at nothing to make sure justice prevails! From the dark streets of Gotham City to the deepest corners of the criminal underworld comes the caped crusader as you&#039;ve never seen him before. Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end the Joker&#039;s reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back... with a vengeance. This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you&#039;re gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, Batman is all business, and he won&#039;t let anything stand in his way!",
