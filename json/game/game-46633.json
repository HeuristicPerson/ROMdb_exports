  "s_synopsis": "Play either the Road Runner OR Wile E. Coyote in this unique side-scroller that is just like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon. Your goal: run through six different desert environments before time expires, collecting ACME stamps. As the Road Runner, speed is your ally as you do incredible jumps, burn though loop-de-loops, and avoid all of the Coyote&#039;s contraptions and ambushes. The Road Runner can also scare an unsuspecting Coyote with his Beep-Beep attack. As the Coyote, you use Acme&#039;s crazy gadgets to catch the Road Runner, constantly attempting to master their power without getting yourself flattened. The Coyote has a special leap attack which allows him to make a last ditch attempt to grab the bird!",
