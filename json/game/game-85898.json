  "s_synopsis": "The world was enmeshed in a terrible conflict. Humans mistrusted Dwarves, Dwarves hated Elves, Elves despised Orcs, and Orcs hated everyone. The rivers ran with the blood of battle and the land stank only of death. Civilization was spiralling towards decay. And the watcher came. He prophesied that a leader would emerge from the south. A leader brave enough to stand face to face with dragons and survive, shrewd enough to solve the most complex enigmas and experienced enough to know when to parley and when to fight. He would be someone familiar with magic, capable of intelligent strategy who would buy, loot and barter with one single aim, to gather a powerful force of men, win back the four king&#039;s crowns and restore the world to everlasting peace. The Watcher has issued his challenge. Dare you take it up?",
