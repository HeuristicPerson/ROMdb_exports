  "s_synopsis": "Evil lurks out there in the universe - even after you defeated the Bacterian forces. It&#039;s 200 years into the future and Gradius is prospering. But one day, a science vessel disappeared into the Evil Range nebula. This started a domino effect which ended in the colonies around Gradius attacked and most of the planet&#039;s army in ruins. Desperately, the Gradius army launched an attack on the source with four ships in hot pursuit. Now only you, aboard your trusty Vic Viper starfighter, can put an end to the Dark Nebula in Gradius Gaiden, yet another shooter in the Gradius series.",
