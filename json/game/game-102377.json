  "s_synopsis": "You are about to be transported 100 years into the future, where wars are no longer fought by missiles and nuclear bombs. With all weapons of mass destruction banned, the latest wave in warfare is the New Age Power-Suit, or NAP - a robotic combat machine which gives the wearer unheard-of fighting ability. Here, you will play the part of Howie Bowie, the finest soldier of the El Shiria Military Nation&#039;s foreign legion, leader of the unit called &quot;Undead&quot;.  You receive your orders via an urgent radio transmission: &quot;Team Undead, occupy and destroy Point A-46K Bloody Axis. Use K-19 Phantom NAP for this operation.&quot; Some would call this an impossible mission. But your NAP can be equipped with up to 14 different weapons, out of 20 available - including flame throwers, land mines, and both hand-held and body-mounted firing equipment. With this kind of firepower to command, your only limitation will be your own strategic sense and combat savvy. The ultimate battlefield -the &quot;Final Zone&quot;- awaits you!",
