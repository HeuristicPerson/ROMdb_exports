All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer.",
