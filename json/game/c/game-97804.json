  "s_synopsis": "Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical &quot;Berzerkers&quot; far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it&#039;s crew. The Berzerker data is used to create &quot;Overtech&quot; and bring to life &quot;Metalliforms&quot;, self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent &quot;CJ&quot;, and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth&#039;s attack.",
