Now, the Black Seal is about to be broken so they can return to wreak havoc on the world once again. Three ragtag adventurers become the only hope of stopping the second coming of Evil. Play as Mail, tomboy bounty-hunter wannabe who&#039;s handy with a blade, Tatt, the ultra-polite apprentice magician with a deadly staff, or Gaw, a winged blue blob with breath of fire, as you search for the manicial Muttonhead, who holds all the answers. During your quest, change characters at any time! You&#039;ll need to, because Nuts Cracker and the minions of Evil will stop at nothing to end your party before it starts!",
