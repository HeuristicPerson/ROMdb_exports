  "s_synopsis": "What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk&#039;s Pro Skater? It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo&#039;s twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks. The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.",
