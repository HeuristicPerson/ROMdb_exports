  "s_synopsis": "In the year 1286, Sir Daniel Fortesque and his soldiers fought against the evil sorcerer Zarok, who raised an army of demons, intending to conquer the world. Sir Daniel was hailed as a hero after the battle, supposedly having been mortally wounded during it, taking Zarok with him. However, it looks like the sorcerer was not defeated in that battle. A hundred years later, he appears again, robbing people of their souls to build an army of undead. Unleashing waves of necromantic energy, Zarok inadvertently revives Sir Daniel as well. Now a skeletal corpse, the knight must correct the mistakes of the past and defeat Zarok once and for all.",
