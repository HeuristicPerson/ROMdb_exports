They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim. But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it&#039;s some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans&#039; main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown. There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the &quot;Red Warrior&quot;, and using your only weapon, an energy ball.\r\n",
