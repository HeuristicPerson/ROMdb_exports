The action is viewed from behind your helicopter, with the 3D polygon world rotating around you, taking in mountains, rivers and deserts. There are 12 missions in total, each of which requires you to destroy targets in a set time limit. There are also training and head-to-head modes against a CPU-controlled drone. ",
