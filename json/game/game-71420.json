  "s_synopsis": "In the far future, a fanatical group of religious extremists known as the Mondites have begun a campaign of galactic conquest. They believe in the evolution of man through machine by cybernetic implants. You are one of the unlucky victims: a prisoner in a Mondite complex on a distant moon, with no memory of your former life. Your body has been turned into a hideous cybernetic nightmare by the evil Dr. Mastaba. It is up to you to explore the complex (abandoned and on the verge of nuclear meltdown), discover the secrets of the Mondites and the mysterious remnants of alien civilization they&#039;ve discovered, and get out alive from this moon.
