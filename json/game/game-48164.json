The resulting chaos caused the barge to crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused extensive damage to both ships. There were only 8 survivors, 4 from each ship. What&#039;s worse, there&#039;s only one escape pod. You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life.",
