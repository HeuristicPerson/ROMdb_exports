  "s_synopsis": "A millenarian spell, transmitted from parents to children, turned the muscular Bully into a fish and the indomitable M\u00f3nica into a hawk. Every full moon one of them suffers a transformation and the other recovers his normal form, which prevents them to be together. Only an extraordinary phenomenon can break the spell, something as extraordinary as a sun eclipse... the Black Sun. In order to break the spell, Bully must free M\u00f3nica (the hawk) of her cage for, turned he in fish, arrive on time together at the sacred submarine temple of the sun, a grotto located beyond the borders of the city submerged of Hidrionis, just at the moment in which the moon is embraced with the sun and a huge shade crosses the planet.",
