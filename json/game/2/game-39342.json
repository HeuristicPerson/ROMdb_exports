  "s_synopsis": "Mega Man 3 is a traditional side-scrolling platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It&#039;s quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It&#039;s also the first time you&#039;re allowed to slide instead of merely walking. ",
