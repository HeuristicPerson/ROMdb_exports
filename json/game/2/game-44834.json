  "s_synopsis": "One or two players control a P-38 and a Mosquito, shooting enemy airplanes and ships. As in the previous games, one button shoots the airplane&#039;s weapon (which is upgradeable by collecting power ups left by enemies) and the other makes the airplane loop, destroying everything on screen. The regular ammo is infinite, while the upgraded weapons have limited ammo. When the weapon button is held down, a bar at the bottom of the screen is charged and a special shot can be released, which varies in effect from weapon to weapon.",
