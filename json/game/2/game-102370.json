And the good news is that your grandfather just told you that you&#039;re to inherit the family jewels. A flashy collection of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, even opals. All yours. The bad news is that they&#039;re hidden inside Count Dracula&#039;s mansion. They have been for years. First, you have to wipe out the bats, Draculas, and eventually their annoying henchman. Then you have to find the hidden keys and passageways that should lead to your family&#039;s long lost treasure. Ghoul luck -- you&#039;ll need it.",
