  "s_synopsis": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Tower of Doom is a 2D side-scrolling, weapon-based beat&#039;em up game set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Mystara campaign setting. The game has some slight RPG elements taken from the tabletop role-playing game. At the start of the game you can pick between 4 characters: cleric, dwarf, elf, and fighter. The game is very similar to Golden Axe - players go right, slash enemies (and various bosses) and use magic or additional weapons. Daggers, hammers, arrows and burning oil can be used as throwing weapons.",
