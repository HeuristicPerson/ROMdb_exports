  "s_synopsis": "Arkanoid: Doh It Again picks up five years after the events in Arkanoid, beginning with a flashback of the spacecraft Vaus defeating DOH with its energy ball. Fast-forwarding to the present day (the 9th stardawn), Commander Therle (presumably the ship&#039;s captain) writes a log entry stating that their search for a new home goes on and that their goal remains elusive. He also states that he knows that DOH is watching and waiting. Then the main menu appears. ",
