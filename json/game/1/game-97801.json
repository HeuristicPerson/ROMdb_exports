  "s_synopsis": "The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king&#039;s magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.",
