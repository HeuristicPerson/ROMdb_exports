  "s_synopsis": "Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You&#039;ll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you&#039;ll die, but not laughing! The there&#039;s the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It&#039;s not all bad! You&#039;ve got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he&#039;s MR. BIG!",
