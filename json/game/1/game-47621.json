  "s_synopsis": "While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a planet covered entirely in slime. You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out. The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas. Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your &quot;friend&quot; to find and get to an exit first. Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.",
