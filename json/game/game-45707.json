  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Virus - It Is Aware&quot; is a loose spin-off of the 1999 horror film &quot;Virus&quot;, and also the &quot;Dark Horse&quot; comic which the film is based on. Despite the fact that the game&#039;s opening and closing cinematics are set on a boat and space station like the film and comic series, the game itself is totally disconnected from both the source material and the game&#039;s own prologue and epilogue, instead being set in a high-tech hotel.\r\n",
