  "s_synopsis": "Get in. Fire it up. And then hang on. You&#039;re in for the ride of your life! Engines scream as the monster truck flies into the lead. All four racers spill over the dirt hill and slam onto the asphalt surface. Pushing past the pack in true dune buggy style, the Sandrail hits an ice patch and skids off the track. The Eurocar crashes through the open hole, but not before dropping off a few mines to slow down any slip-streamers.",
