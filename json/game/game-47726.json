  "s_synopsis": "This game comes at you with a Fantastic Voyage tale of a microsurgeon miniaturized to a near-microscopic scale in order to enter the body and save the life of a tobacco salesman, ironically laid low by health complications caused by the very cigarettes he sold. Rex must be asking himself, &quot;My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone&#039;s lungs like a window-washer?&quot; But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman&#039;s recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -and Rex&#039;s- untimely demises.",
