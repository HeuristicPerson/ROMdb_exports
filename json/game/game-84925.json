  "s_synopsis": "It all begins with the song of a lone bard in a bustling pub. Great nations such as the Varennes Empire, which had once ensured peace throughout the world, stagnated and atrophied over the course of centuries, and sinister forces started emerging in outlying areas. Ere long, peace spiraled into war and the common folk spoke in hushed words of the Seven Heroeshistorical figures who saved the world once and who, it was hoped, would do so again.",
