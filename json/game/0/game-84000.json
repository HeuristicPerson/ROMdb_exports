It&#039;s up to you, as Donkey Kong Jr., to rescue your father by stealing Mario&#039;s set of keys. But it won&#039;t be easy. You&#039;ll have to fight off ape-eating Snapjaws, jump onto moving islands and break through a jungle of vines to get to the keys that will free Donkey Kong. Can you handle the action?
