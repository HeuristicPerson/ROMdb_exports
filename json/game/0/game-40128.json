  "s_synopsis": "Last Battle is a side-scrolling beat-em-up game in which the player takes control of a martial artist named Aarzak who must single-handedly (and -footedly) defeat the lackeys of an evil fighter called Duke, and eventually stand against three generals who have kidnapped his girlfriend. The hero fights using punches and kicks, combining these moves with jumping and crouching. He also has a special power meter that refills over the time. When the power meter is full, Aarzak gains a boost that allows him to perform rapid attacks for the rest of the stage. \r\n",
