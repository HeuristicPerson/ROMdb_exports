  "s_synopsis": "It is yet another lovely day at Sony&#039;s HQ when top executives march into the titular Boss&#039; office to deliver the news that the very last Nintendo PlayStation prototype has fallen in the hands of the public and homebrew enthusiasts have already managed to fully emulate the system. This represents a great shame for the Boss who had decades ago ordered the destruction of every single prototype. Being a very hands-on executive, instead of calmly discussing the situation and planning out the proper legal counter action, he promptly switches to rampage mode and proceeds to punch, kick and throw everything in sight, including employees and PlayStation mascots.
