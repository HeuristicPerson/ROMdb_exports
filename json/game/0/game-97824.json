Take the Cyber Car to victory over some of the meanest courses ever devised? Competing requires fast reflexes and cool nerves. Swerve through tight curves, past bottomless canyons and high above City streets. Don&#039;t let a single car get past you - to win you gotta drive as if your life depends on it. Every course is increasingly more difficult. Rise to the challenge and make our way through the toughest terrain that countries as Peru, Kenya, Spain, England, and America have to offer.",
