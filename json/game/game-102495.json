  "s_synopsis": "Dragons of Flame explodes with action! Control up to ten Companions, one at a time. Your quest: rescue slaves held by the ravaging Dragonarmies in the foul fortress of Pax Tharkas. Your journey begins as the Companions explore the wilderness of the Elven Mosaic where they gain valuable allies - the mysterious elves of Qualinesti.\r\nEach Companion has different specialized skills. Use them wisely along the way to evade evil Draconian patrols. Keep one step ahead of the malevolent Dragonarmies while battling Dragons, Giant Wasps, Griffins, Wraiths, Zombies, and scores of other monsters! All the terrors of the journey, however, pale in comparison to the sheer horror of your destination. The impenetrable fortress of Pax Tharkas looms before you, crackling with vile energy.\r\nRemember, all the sizzling action happens in real-time and in colorful animation. Your wits and reflexes better be sharp. In this game, you&#039;re either quick... Or you&#039;re dead.",
