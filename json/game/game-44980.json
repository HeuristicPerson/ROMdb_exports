  "s_synopsis": "Carrier Air Wing is a 2D side scrolling arcade shooter. The player chooses one of three different jet fighters (F-14 Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet and A-6E Intruder). The game is a pretty standard shmup - player flies to the right and shoots enemies and bosses. Carrier Air Wing has a quasi-modern war style, but has several sci-fi elements (like a giant spider-robot). The game is a spiritual descendant of U.N. Squadron, and has shops - player can upgrade ships between stages.",
