Like towers taller than the Empire State Building. What the bonehead also neglected to tell you is that there are 8 of these monuments hidden in the middle of a toxic ocean. And that to get rid of them, you&#039;ve gotta work your way to the top of them. Plus one more itty bitty detail: The more towers you topple, the tougher the next one gets! ",
