  "s_synopsis": "1945k III is a vertical scrolling shoot-em up, inspired by Strikers 1945 III. The player controls a plane and shoots enemies. He can select one from 7 fighters (based on real planes), each with different weapons and special ability. Gameplay is typical (on the border line between &quot;normal&quot; shoot&#039;em ups and bullet hell shooters) - just fly straightforward, avoid bullets and destroy all enemies, bosses included.",
