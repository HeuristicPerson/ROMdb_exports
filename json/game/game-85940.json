  "s_synopsis": "Set in the Aragonian Empire, you are heir to the late Duke of Aladda, and your task is to once again extend Aladda&#039;s dominion and eventually crown yourself king in Tetrada. Executing your father&#039;s will properly means raising and equipping an army, then venturing forth to do battle against the dastardly foes threatening Aladda and its surroundings. Your success in Sword of Aragon depends on the careful allocation of precious resources, astute military planning, and deft combat maneuvers. Knights, priests, warriors, mages, rangers, cavalry, infantry, and bowmen are some of the units you can recruit, and in true AD&amp;D fashion, you can equip them with different armor types. ",
