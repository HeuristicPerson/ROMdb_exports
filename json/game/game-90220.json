  "s_synopsis": "Warning! Ancient Terror is on the Loose! In the 1930&#039;s, famed archaeologist Earnest Evans unearthed his greatest challenge: three ancient idols that together could bring an end to life on Earth. The idols were scattered at random throughout the world by the god of the winds, Hastur, before its power was crushed. Yet Evans was injured before he could complete the search. Fifty years pass and now its up to Dr. Evans&#039; grandson Earnest to save the world. But in his way are giant scorpions, humongous Venus Fly Traps and the thugs controlled by syndicate leader Brady Tresidder. As young Earnest Evans you will travel to the furthest reaches of the planet in search of clues to contain the power of Mavur, which, if summond, can wipe life clean off the surface and use Earth as a taxi to roam the universe forever.",
