  "s_synopsis": "The odds are definitely against them. The enemy&#039;s coming by land, by sea, and by air, with an arsenal of every deadly weapon known to man. Tanks. Machine guns. Battleships. And the most villainous army of soldiers this peaceful little land has ever seen. And the defense? Just two lonely skykids in thinly armed, single engine prop bi-planes. They&#039;ve got guts, but they&#039;ll need help from Above to win this battle - a steady hand, lightning reflexes, nerves of steel, and a heart of gold. Do you have what it takes? Then fasten your seat belt and take a deep breath. Because you are their only hope, Sky Kid!",
