  "s_synopsis": "West life is nothing easy. Especially if we consider that in most of the towns exists a series of people who suffer from two defects: avarice and presumption. This is the case of the Zorton Brothers, two gunmen and real bad guys who think that they are the center of the world, and that all the other mortals must obey them. In addition, they enjoy killing the weakest and making them suffer, something that we are sure you, intrepid &quot;justiciero&quot;, can&#039;t allow anymore. The Zorton Brothers have arrived at a calm, Pacific town whose sheriff acts as more decorative than practical. He is small, weak, without aim and too talkative. Before this panorama, the Zorton have decided to seize the town with the inestimable aid of their band. It is up to you to save the town from their clutches.",
