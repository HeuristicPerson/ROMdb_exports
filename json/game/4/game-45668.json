  "s_synopsis": "In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&#039;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&#039;s Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That&#039;s where Carnby comes in. Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices. Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell&#039;s Kitchen and Jack&#039;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. ",
