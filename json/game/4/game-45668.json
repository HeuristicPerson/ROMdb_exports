Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&#039;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&#039;s Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That&#039;s where Carnby comes in. Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices. Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell&#039;s Kitchen and Jack&#039;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. ",
