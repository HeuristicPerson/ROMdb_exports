Strap on your time-control bracelet and embark on the greatest adventure of all time-in a game loaded with all the toe-curling thrills of the big screen blockbuster. As time enforcement officer, Max Walker, it&#039;s up to you to wage war through the ages. Mobsters in 1929 Wall Street, soldiers in World War II Germany. Street punks in 2117 L.A... not even time is on your side as you do everything to crush Kleindast-and save history as we know it. The moment has come. Let the time duel begin!",
