  "s_synopsis": "Ten years ago, the elder of the village Ryuen found you, a little child, near the village gate. Nobody knew where you came from, but in your hands you were holding an egg. This egg was carefully preserved, and now, after ten years, a dragon has hatched from it - a white dragon who can talk! It became clear that you are one of the legendary Dragonriders. Now the Elder has a new task for you. The Dragonrider Amrita, who has been taking good care of you during those ten years, has betrayed the Guild, set the Guild&#039;s warehouse on fire, and fled Ryuen with her dragon. It is your mission to locate her, to bring her back, and to find out why she disappeared.",
