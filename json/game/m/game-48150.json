  "s_synopsis": "You are police officer Bob, whose aim is to apprehend a certain quota of criminals (litterbugs, speeders and the like) each day. This is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at them - in some cases they will need ramming off the road. There are also hardened criminals to catch - if you can get one of these to confess, your day&#039;s work is considered done. Bonuses are awarded for achieving a &quot;perfect day&quot; and for each arrest additional to the quota. Each day has a time limit but this can be extended by collecting donuts.",
