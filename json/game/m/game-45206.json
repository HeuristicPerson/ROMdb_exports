  "s_synopsis": "Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It&#039;s a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol&#039; smash-mouth kind, literally. Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it&#039;s all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him &#039;til he&#039;s dead. Suspect the ref&#039;s been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it&#039;s a 5 yard penalty though. Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend. There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.",
