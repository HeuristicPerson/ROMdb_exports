His name was Gilbas, and he was about to destroy the inhabitants of the land. Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came. Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to defeat Gilbas: &quot;The Orb of Light&quot;, &quot;The Amulet of Light&quot;, and &quot;The Knife of Light&quot;. ",
