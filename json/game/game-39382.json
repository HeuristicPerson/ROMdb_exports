  "s_synopsis": "Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series&#039; timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick&#039;s grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.",
