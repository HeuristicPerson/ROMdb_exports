  "s_synopsis": "After the events of Thunder Force IV, the fighter craft &quot;Rynex&quot; drifted into the Sol System where it was captured and studied by Earth scientists. On Earth&#039;s moon they built the supercomputer Guardian to delve into the mysteries of the ship. Guardian not only proved it was capable of deciphering the Vasteel&#039;s complex systems through reverse engineering, but also in implementing and advancing the technology which had made the Rynex so formidable as a starfighter. Guardian later achieved full consciousness and in return, began to deliver massive strikes against the Earth itself. The Unified Earth government was swiftly defeated, and their last hope is Cenes Crawford and a hotshot group of ace pilots who are sent against Guardian and its forces.",
