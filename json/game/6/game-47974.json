  "s_synopsis": "A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent&#039;s strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.",
