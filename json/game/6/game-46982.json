  "s_synopsis": "Once there was a prosperous kingdom, which was protected by a tower, where a mighty dragon was living. The people of the kingdom were secure with such a guardian. But one man wanted the dragon&#039;s power for something else, and this man was the king. He went to the tower and tried to kill the dragon, in order to rob his power. But the dragon&#039;s fury turned the king into a horrible creature, a demon, and his evil essence made his entire kingdom sink deep under the earth. Many years have passed, and now you take control of a traveler named Varik (Ares in the Japanese version). A young woman accuses him of killing her teacher, and in a desperate fight they both fall underground, to where the lost kingdom was buried. You must guide Varik through underground mazes and help him to escape the wrath of his adversary and the demonic inhabitants of the lost kingdom.",
