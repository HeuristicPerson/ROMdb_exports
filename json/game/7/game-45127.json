  "s_synopsis": "The story focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world&#039;s high technology. Shinra supports this technology with Mako Energy, Shinra&#039;s patented source of power. Unfortunately Mako is the lifeblood of the living planet and by using it up Shinra is slowly upsetting the balance of nature. In comes AVALANCHE, a rebel group of disenfranchised citizens who have taken it upon themselves to oppose Shinra&#039;s ambitions. The main character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst-ridden fellow with a complex history that is explained as the game goes on. Cloud joins up with AVALANCHE as a mercenary for hire, and together they take on Shinra&#039;s maniacal executives and their army of shock-troops, robots, and mutants. However, after a while it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra, but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world.",
