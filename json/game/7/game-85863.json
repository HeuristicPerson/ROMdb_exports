Recognizing the imperfect nature of their creators, the Robotrons conclude that the inefficient human race must be exterminated. Only you and a single family of clones remain. If mankind is to survive, you must destroy the Grunts, Brains, Enforcers, and Tanks - but avoid the indestructible Hulks at all cost. Can you withstand wave after wave of android invasion... before it&#039;s too late?",
