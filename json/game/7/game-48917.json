A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon&#039;s revival. With the help of Alcahest&#039;s power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire&#039;s evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.",
