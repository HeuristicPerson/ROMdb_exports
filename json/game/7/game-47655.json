One day, a mysterious old man appears out of nowhere, approaches Adyu and tells him the world needs more paladins, and therefore you must train harder in order to become one. He sends you on a quest to find a legendary weapon, which is broken into twelve parts, each part being hidden in a different place. He also entrusts you with the power of Ryu, a huge magical armor that grants the hero who equips it immense power. This is where Adyu&#039;s journey begins!\r\n",
