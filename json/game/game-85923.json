  "s_synopsis": "When I heard I&#039;d won the Krusty the Clown art contest, I said, &quot;Forget it, man. This is Bart Simpson you&#039;re talking to, and Bart Simpson never won anything in his life.&quot; But Krusty said it, so there&#039;s no way to deny it. My family and I get to go on this really cool worldwide Treasure Hunt - to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need your help if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy Show. Here&#039;s the deal: I have to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products. The faces are worth bonuses and power-ups, and if I collect all the products I get a special reward. Wish me luck, man. I&#039;m outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.",
