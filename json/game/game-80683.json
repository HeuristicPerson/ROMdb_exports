  "s_synopsis": "Get Ready For A Heavy Metal Explosion. You say you&#039;re not the hero type? Don&#039;t want to put your flesh and blood on the line? Too bad. Because the only choice your metal head competition is going to give you is to perish now or perish later. What did you expect from an alien horde or robo sociopaths who&#039;d like to have you as their next microwave dinner? Unless you enjoy being cooked from the inside out, may we suggest that you save yourself from these robot stormtroopers by climbing into the Dynamor, a suit of dynamic armor that happens to fit only you. But hurry, Dynamor without you is no more scary to the metal heads from Imperium than a sheet of aluminum wrap.\r\nImperium. Real Heavy Metal Fun.",
