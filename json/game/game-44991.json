Your uncle informs you of this shortly before his death, and after travelling to his castle you find that you must travel through time to correct these wrongdoings. Through a range of murals at your uncle&#039;s house, various past scenes must be entered, with more becoming available as you complete them. In each you must find and kill your demented relative in time.",
