  "s_synopsis": "You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five death-defying stunts: 1) You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire; 2) Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way; 3) Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball; 4) Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way; 5) Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing. Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.",
