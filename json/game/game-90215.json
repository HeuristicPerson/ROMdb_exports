  "s_synopsis": "The evil Kat of Nine Tails has imprisoned the friendly blue creatures on planet Grool - even chopped off their tails! Only Squeak escaped the horrifying, tail whacking rampage. Though now the blue being has landed in a strange new world with an even stranger kid named Bubble! Bubble and Squeak must return to Glool and collect enough gems and coins to make the sinister Kat turn tail and run. But they have to work together! Kick Squeak into a spinning frenzy to help Bubble overcome obstacles! Help Squeak give Bubble a lift by tossing him high above danger! Then feed Squeak the magic gumballs and ride piggyback to victory! Bubble and Squeak are poised to pounce on the evil Kat. But alien caverns, snake-infested swamplands and fire-spewing dragons await! And the fur is about to fly!",
