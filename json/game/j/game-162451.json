  "s_synopsis": "Is nothing sacred? RollerGames, the 21st Century&#039;s most popular thrill sport, is the latest victim of V.I.P.E.R. (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades). With their greedy eyes on RollerGames&#039; mega prize money, they&#039;ve corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson &quot;Skeeter&quot; Bankhead, the games&#039; beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.&#039;s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you&#039;ve got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.&#039;s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can&#039;t punch you through, you&#039;ll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It&#039;s a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter&#039;s life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!",
