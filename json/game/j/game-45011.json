The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. The player must guide Jill Valentine out of the city alive. Along the way, Jill will interact with and receive help from three Umbrella mercenaries who are also stranded in Raccoon City. Standing in the way of your group&#039;s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.\r\n",
