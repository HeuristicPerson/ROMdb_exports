  "s_synopsis": "Gizmo is trapped inside Clamp Centre by the evil Gremlins. Your mission? Help him battle his way to the control center and rid the city forever of the Gremlin menace! It&#039;s not going to be easy. You&#039;ll have to use cunning and wits to survive with only the weapons you find inside Clamp Centre... matches, a flashlight, tomatoes, and a homemade bow and arrow. But, if you&#039;re lucky, the door to Mr. Wing&#039;s Magic Shop may mystically appear... and let you buy some very special - and powerful - items to help you. This game has all the traps, mazes, and lightning quick moves to push your skill to the limits. And it has graphics that seem to come alive on the screen. Gremlins. Stopping them is not going to be easy. Don&#039;t say we didn&#039;t warn you!",
