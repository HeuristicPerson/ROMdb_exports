  "s_synopsis": "Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, called Metroid, is in a state of suspended animation and, according to analysis, was the cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If it ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless other systems.\r\n\r\nThe pirates have taken the being to the planet Zebes and are fending off the Galactic Federation&#039;s attacks. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus Aran to find her way into the planet&#039;s core, destroy the pirates, and take back the alien before the pirates complete their plans of world destruction.\r\n\r\nZero Mission takes Samus back to her first battle with Mother Brain, expanding on the original story line and action from the original Nintendo classic, Metroid, with updated visuals, new puzzles to solve, and cut scenes filling in the personal story of Samus.",
