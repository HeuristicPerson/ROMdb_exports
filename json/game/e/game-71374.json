Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships. The 5-man squad, encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders (executed simultaneously) via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time.",
