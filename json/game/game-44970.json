Warriors of Destiny picks up where Quest of the Avatar left off; a self-contained game continuing the characters and challenges that have made Ultima the greatest series of role playing games ever! Lord British has disappeared in the Underworld and the once-trusted Blackthorn has risen to power. You, the Avatar, hero of Britannia, and your team must rescue Lord British. On the way you&#039;ll meet hundreds of characters in panoramic lands; you&#039;ll battle the Shadowlords, horrible creatures bent on total destruction. But will you ever escape from the Underworld? Real role playing excitement!",
