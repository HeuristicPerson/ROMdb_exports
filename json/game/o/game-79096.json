  "s_synopsis": "A little bit of history with a little bit of mystery as you relive the nightmarish trek of Stanley in his search for the long lost missionary, Dr. Livingstone. But no African jungle was ever as forbidding as the treacherous journey that lies in wait for you. Poison darts from the pygmies, blood-spattering pit hammers in the diamond mines, spear-throwing natives in the bush... even the white men are hostile and would rather see you dead than alive. It&#039;s spine-chilling action every step of the way with a little adventure thrown in for good measure - hidden gems, secret temples?",
