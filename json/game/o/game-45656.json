  "s_synopsis": "Neo Kobe is city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country&#039;s secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called &quot;Snatchers&quot; because they &quot;snatch&quot; their victims before they take their place. A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs. Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked, is it a person or a snatcher? ",
