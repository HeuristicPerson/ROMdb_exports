  "s_synopsis": "Abe is a Mudokon, a member of a once prosperous race which has now been enslaved by the Glukkons, forced to work in their huge corporations. The food factories have found a new type of meat, delicious to all the inhabitants, though no one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders&#039; conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. Alas, Abe has been spotted, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can&#039;t leave his friends to the mercy of the Glukkons and their henchmen. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth about what he has found out.",
