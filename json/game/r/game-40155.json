  "s_synopsis": "Raiden Fighters Jet is a 2D vertical-scrolling shooter, the last game in Raiden Fighters sub-series. The story is non-typical - the game is just a advanced simulation program and the player tests combat skills. He chooses one from 14 planes (all available in previous games come back). Gameplay is quite typical - fly forward, collect medals, shoot various enemies, and destroy bosses, but the difficulty level depends on player&#039;s skills - the last mission (&quot;Real Mission&quot;) can be reached only without using &quot;continue&quot;.",
