  "s_synopsis": "When a ruthless gang led by Big Al invades their turf, it&#039;s up to the Brawl Brothers to take back their streets and send their rivals home with their tails between their legs. You can go at it alone or team up with a friend for some simultaneous two-player action as you kick, punch, and body slam your way to victory through six stages of no holds barred, hand-to-hand fighting action. There are all kinds of realistic street-fighting techniques to master, including body slams, leg sweeps, jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. If you want a fight but aren&#039;t feeling friendly, then turn the tables on your friend and go head-to-head for bragging rights and control of the streets.",
