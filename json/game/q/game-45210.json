  "s_synopsis": "The sequel to &quot;Saga Frontier&quot;, but also to the less known &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; games, &quot;Saga Frontier 2&quot; allows you to play the stories of two main characters - a young prince Gustave XIII, who has been exiled from his homeland because he was unable to use the mysterious power of Anima and to become a worthy successor to the throne, and William Knights, a treasure hunter, who strives to find ancient artifacts containing great powers. Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. ",
