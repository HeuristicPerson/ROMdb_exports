  "s_synopsis": "With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit &quot;mystery bricks&quot;, wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind \u2013 instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.",
