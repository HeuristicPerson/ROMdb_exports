  "s_synopsis": "&quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast &quot;barbarians&quot;, the heavily armored but slow &quot;knights&quot;, and the ranged &quot;archers&quot;. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: &quot;spies&quot;, which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.",
