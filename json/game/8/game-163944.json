  "s_synopsis": "At first, it looked like just another revolution. But reports have come in that the rebel forces are backed by an unusual array of high-tech weaponry - and that the rebel soldiers may actually be a fearsome new breed of fighting robots! If this revolution succeeds, the safety of the entire world may be threatened... And that&#039;s where you come in. You must attempt to infiltrate the island base of the rebel forces. But before you even reach the shore, you&#039;ll have to contend with enemy gunboats, frogmen, choppers, and destroyers. If you make it to the island, you&#039;ll find it patrolled by enemy soldiers armed with machine guns, daggers and grenades; vicious attack dogs; and lethal airborne probes, programmed to destroy intruders on sight. Other unknown dangers lie in wait as well. But if you manage to reach the rebel headquarters, you will face the most terrifying threat of all - only no one has made it back to reveal its nature! You&#039;ll be equipped with a complete arsenal - an assault gun, rocket launcher and grenades - to provide you with a fully mechanized system of attack. You haven&#039;t got a minute to waste - it&#039;s time to launch your &quot;Mechanized Attack&quot;!",
