Capture them, contain them, and confine them...score points for capturing big groups of Qubes! Just don&#039;t touch the black Qubes, because...well...you&#039;re dead if you do. And the rules are very simple. If you lose, you die. So you know what to do, right? That&#039;s right...don&#039;t die.\r\n",
