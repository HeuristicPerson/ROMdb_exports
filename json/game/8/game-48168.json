  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Saiyuki - Journey West&quot; is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel&#039;s hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong, as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang&#039;s gender, giving each monster a more powerful &quot;were-&quot; form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang&#039;s, to an elemental affinity.",
