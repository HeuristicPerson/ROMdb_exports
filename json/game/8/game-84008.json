  "s_synopsis": "There&#039;s a board. There are pieces with varying powers, squares to move into and an opponent to conquer. Once you decide where to attack, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your pieces, which include phoenixes, golems and wizards, fight the banshees, goblins and sorceresses. They cast spells and throw missiles in a fight to the finish. Only if you&#039;re smart, fast and dextrous will you win.",
