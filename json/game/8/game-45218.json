  "s_synopsis": "In this game your goal is to find out who you are. One of your only clues is a bar code on your neck. At the beginning of the game, you awaken on the floor, with a gun in place of one of your arms, no memory, and police helicopters shooting missiles through your window. From here, it&#039;s nonstop action as you battle your way across the city and countryside, constantly pursued by the police and miliary.",
