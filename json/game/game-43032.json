  "s_synopsis": "2D side-scrolling beat&#039;em up, based on the anime/manga series Sailor Moon. The game is comparable to Final Fight, or the previous Bish\u014djo Senshi Sailor Moon R game based on the same licence. One or two players can choose one out of five female characters: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mars and Sailor Jupiter. In typical genre fashion, the gameplay consists of advancing through the stages by fighting various standard enemies and bosses with punches, kicks and special moves. There is also a magic system, comparable to Golden Axe, based on crystals. More crystals allow stronger attacks.",
