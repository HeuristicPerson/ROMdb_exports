Brain-boggling mazes, traps and bizarre pitfalls stand in your way back to Ufouria. You&#039;ll rely on your friends to survive in this strange, changing world. But beware. You better have the right powers for the strange worlds you&#039;ll encounter... or you lose. As you make your trek through mystical forests, deserts and oceans, you&#039;ll need to seek out and destroy monstrous creatures every step of the way. Will you have the right powers at the right time? Don&#039;t let the mind-zapping colors and stupefying sound effects throw you off. Remember - it&#039;s only a game.",
