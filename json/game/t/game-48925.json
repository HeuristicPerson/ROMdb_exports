  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Pig Mock&quot; is an action game where you, Pig Mock, must catch dropped eggs and transfer them to funnels at the side of the screen. The eggs are dropped by Thunder Pants who are some creatures living in the clouds. Pig Mock has a frying pan with which to collect the eggs, Pressing up allows the eggs to be thrown upwards, and any Thunder Pants hit by a red egg will fall from the cloud, before eventually being replaced. Dropped eggs will stay on the floor, until cleaned up by Uncle Dust-pan who periodically crosses the screen, eating the smashed eggs. After eating enough eggs, Uncle Dust-pan will grow in size and cannot be jumped.",
