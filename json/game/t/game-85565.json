  "s_synopsis": "Dezaemon Plus is an updated release of Dezaemon. Both games allow players to create their own vertical shooters through use of an icon-driven tool set. Players can control enemy placement, behavior, weapons, powerups, boss firing points, and so on. A graphics editor allows players to draw backgrounds, along with sprites for players, enemies, and even explosions. A music editor, very similar to the one in Mario Paint allows players to construct background themes for each level. Players are limited to a maximum of five levels, and a limited amount of shared memory for all graphics.",
