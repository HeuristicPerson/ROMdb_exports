Recently, the formerly benevolent king Lassic converted to a new religion and begins to rule Algol with an iron fist. Nero, the leader of a rebel group, is brutally killed by Lassic&#039;s robotic policemen. His last words were addressed to his sister Alis: he implores her to find a warrior named Odin.
