Defeat all the enemies to advance to the next parsec. If you come into contact with an enemy or enemy missile, you&#039;ll lose a fighter. Once you lose all of your fighters, the game is over. Obtain Blaster Head power-ups by destroying the enemies that carry them. Collect parts for your fighter by destroying the enemies that carry them. Complete a full set to earn an extra fighter. During Challenging Stages, enemies will spin and bounce when hit. Keep juggling enemies within the bounds of the screen to earn bonus points.",
