  "s_synopsis": "The supernatural alien Vaprak threatens to defeat our world which is the last planet that stands between him and a dimensional vortex. This vortex leads to a fifth and, up until now, lost dimension. If he succeeds in defeating us, he will destroy our world, opening a gateway for his kind as well as the strange mutating effect that this dimension has on all organic life forms. His forces are far too strong for us to defeat in a frontal attack which is why Special Agent Jim Power is sent to slip past his Omni-eye scanners and make an assassination attempt on the greatest evil that man has ever known. It will take absolutely all of his wits and skill but it is imperative that he reaches Vaprak&#039;s fortress and sends him back to the sulphurous plane from whence he came.",
