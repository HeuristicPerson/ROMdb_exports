  "s_synopsis": "Having fought in the Middle East, South America, within the United States, and in the former U.S.S.R, your path has now lead you to the heart of Asia. You follow the trail of Colonel LeMonde, who has terrorized South East Asia. LeMonde is armed with one prototype nuclear missile warhead, modified to catalyze a chain reaction that can completely destroy the ozone layer and thus irradiate the Earth. Your hunt starts in Indocine (intended to suggest Indochina, the mainland of SE Asia), then to the South China Sea to combat Napoleon Hwong, then to the heart of North Korea to uncovering the nuclear schemes of Kym Zung-Lee, and then to Siberia for a final battle. \r\n",
