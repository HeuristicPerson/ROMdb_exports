However, peace never lasts. The Garuda Empire has invaded the lands of Mistral, and the six Dark Generals, led by Sornbul, have conquered the continents. Sornbul&#039;s ambition is nothing less than to resurrect Deoric and plunge the land into chaos. Duran, descendant of Drak, is the only one who can stop the Garuda Empire&#039;s mad plan, and with the power of Drak&#039;s mystic armors, he heads off to stop Sornbul at any cost.",
