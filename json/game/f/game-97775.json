To succeed in 3D, you gotta have brains and brawn. But most importantly, you gotta have Ballz. You play Ballz in a high-tech cyberworld run by the Jester - the sultan of insultin&#039; who&#039;s gonna toy with you till you cry. He has nine hilarious and vicious characters plus eight killer bosses. The gruesome character, Zombie, is new to the Director&#039;s Cut.
