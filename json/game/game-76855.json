  "s_synopsis": " It&#039;s time to get mythical and kick some Greek monster butt. Try on the super-strength of Hercules, or the fighting speed of Atlanta, or the street smarts of Jason. It&#039;s open season on the one-eyed Cyclops, the multi-headed Hydra, Medusa with the snake hairdo, sword-swinging skeletons, deranged gods, nasty Martians, crazy clowns and other not-so-mythological monstrosities. With your arsenal of arrows, slingshots, swords, houses, sheep, inflarable cows and ray guns it&#039;s up to you to save ancient civilization from massive myth-fortune.",
