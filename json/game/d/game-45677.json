  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Mutant Fighter&quot; is a versus fighting game with several stand-out features. With the exception of Hercules, playable characters have no names: they either represent a warrior class (Fighter, Amazoness), or are popular mythological beings (Minotaur, Beast, Dragon, and Golem). The game has two modes: single-player, in which the player selects a fighter and competes against computer-controlled opponents in a strict order, and two-player mode, where both players can choose their characters. Unlike most versus fighting games, the battles take place on a square arena instead of the usual horizontal screens. Wrestling moves (such as grappling) are widely utilized. Special energy can be accumulated and then unleashed as powerful attacks.",
