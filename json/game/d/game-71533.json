His latest invention is an Interdimensional Warpgate which allows access to worlds beyond our own. As the doctor&#039;s younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos&#039; mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures. To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn&#039;t looking too good. Strange &quot;holes&quot; into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.",
