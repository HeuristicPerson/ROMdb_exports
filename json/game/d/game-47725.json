While out scouting in the Dreighton Nebula, Rookie One&#039;s patrols receive a distress call from a freighter. As this is an area where ships are known to disappear, any deviation from the flight path is dangerous. But what they find is an Imperial presence where there shouldn&#039;t be one... and a new secret project to bring about the destruction of the Rebel Alliance.",
