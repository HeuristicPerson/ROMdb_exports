  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Sensible Golf&quot; is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player&#039;s only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.",
