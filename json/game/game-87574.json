They choose a seemingly undeveloped planet, Earth. Using your defense ship &quot;Syd&quot;, you must destroy the invading forces and ground targets with bombs. Obtain power-ups to gain energy for ship upgrades that allow you to transform to a more powerful machine. The game itself is a vertical shooter, moving continuously up towards the top of the screen.",
