  "s_synopsis": "Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas.",
