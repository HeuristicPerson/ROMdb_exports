  "s_synopsis": "Let me introduce myself. I&#039;m Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting&#039;s my game, and yours, too, if you&#039;re daring enough to take this trip with me. Don&#039;t be nervous; I&#039;ll be your guide through the jungle, and I&#039;m one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We&#039;ll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We&#039;ll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We&#039;ll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we&#039;ll be off to seek a king&#039;s ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry&#039;s Jungle Adventure.",
