Each location is made up of three stages and a boss fight with each stage having a damsel tied up who needs rescuing. Each stage has various platforms and you must move around the screen bashing dinosaurs and other cavemen with your club while trying to get to the damsel to free her. Once any caveman/dinosaur has been bashed, you bag them before throwing them across the screen which will also remove any other cavemen/dinosaurs they hit.",
