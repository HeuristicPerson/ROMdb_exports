  "s_synopsis": "Based on the 1969 British film The Italian Job starring Michael Caine, this third-person mission-based racing game offers 16 missions, 50 levels, five game modes, two &quot;free ride&quot; levels, and an eight-player party mode. With a simple four-key control scheme, you&#039;ll race as Charlie Croker across London, Turin, and the Alps in the main event, unlocking missions as you go, with an eye on the prize of a four million dollar gold bullion heist at journey&#039;s end. Fifteen vehicles are available in the The Italian Job, including three classic Mini-Cooper S cars, 4x4s, and a motor coach.",
