  "s_synopsis": "On a tiny, remote planet, the evil Bungeling Empire is creating an awesome war machine. Civilization as we know it seems doomed. One faint hope remains. A single highly mobile raider might be able to carry out a surgical strike to the heart of The War Machine. Only a fighter pilot of enormous skill and courage could hope to neutralize all six Bungeling islands. Even as you strike at one island, robots repair the damage you&#039;ve done, attacking again and again with a savage arsenal of destruction.",
