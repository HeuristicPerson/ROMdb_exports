  "s_synopsis": "History was never quite like this. In a &quot;creative interpretation&quot; of the Battle of Little Big Horn, a rowdy and naked General Custer must make his way through a hail of continual arrows to a Native American Princess tied to a pole. If Custer can survive the obstacles in his way, he then gets an opportunity to have &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; for big points. Whether his needs have been sated, or brought down by enemy fire, Custer will return again and again to get what he wants.",
