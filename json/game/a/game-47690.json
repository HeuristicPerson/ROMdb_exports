  "s_synopsis": "Blood Bros. is a wild west themed shooter, similar to Cabal. Up to two players control either a cowboy or a native American, shooting their way through the fictional Dodge City. Enemies come in the form of cowboys and native Americans, either on foot or on horseback. Players can also destroy large parts of the background; barrels, glass bottles, stalagmites, bridges, tipi&#039;s and even entire buildings or mountains can be leveled. When the enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen is empty the level is completed and any remaining buildings will collapse by themselves. A chirpy and up-beat jingle is played and the players dance comically into the distance.",
