  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; puts you in the role of the vampire Kain as he searches for his slain brethren. You&#039;ll move through crowds while cloaked in stealth, feed on the peasant herds, and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. With each success, you gain dark powers that give you access to treacherous new areas and help you fight stronger enemies. As you develop your vampire skills, you&#039;ll unfold the continuing epic of Nosgoth and Kain&#039;s attempts to rule over the realm .",
