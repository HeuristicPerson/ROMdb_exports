  "s_synopsis": "arate Champ is an action fighting game for one or two players. The players compete against each other at nine different locations to see who has the best karate skills! To win a match, the player must win two of three rounds by knocking down his opponent with a wide variety of karate moves. A full point or half a point is awarded for knocking your opponent down and the first player to gain a two point lead wins the round. Should the 30 second time limit for a round end, the player who has the most points wins. At the end of each match is a bonus round where the victor can earn extra points by knocking down flying objects that are tossed his way.\r\n",
