  "s_synopsis": "Battle in the air for control of the sea. As a Japanese or American World War II pilot, attack the enemy&#039;s ships in fighters, dive bombers, or torpedo bombers. Outfit an entire squadron in one of the seven campaign wars. But it won&#039;t be easy. Your opponent will send up defense fighters, and shoot you out of the sky with antiaircraft fire. Destroy your target, and then, somehow coax your battered planes to your aircraft carrier. No time for rest; prepare your defenses because the enemy is coming after you.",
