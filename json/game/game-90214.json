  "s_synopsis": "Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent, rabbit-like creatures called Mimiga run free. You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you&#039;re in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village, you discover that the once-carefree Mimiga are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. Their only hope rests squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can&#039;t remember his own name. Take control, learn the origins of this world&#039;s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga.",
