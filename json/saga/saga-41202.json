They share a common story arc and a recurrent protagonist, a Japanese teenage girl named Y\u016bko Asou (Yuko Ahso in most English translations), who is summoned to a parallel world known as Vecanti, which she must protect with the help of the magical sword Valis. This sword is usually also the primary weapon in most of the games; it can be upgraded to shoot projectiles of various types. In most Valis games the protagonists also have access to magic spells. Later installments of the series allow the player to switch between multiple protagonists.",
