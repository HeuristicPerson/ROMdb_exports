  "s_synopsis": "Myst games are played from a first-person perspective and place a strong emphasis on complex puzzles. They are set in fictional realms known as Ages, which can be created and accessed by writing and using the so-called &quot;linking books&quot;. The practice of writing such books originated with an ancient race known as D&#039;ni, who had arrived on the Earth over ten thousand years ago, and founded a thriving civilization in its underground caverns. However, this culture was destroyed by a terrible disease that annihilated almost the entire D&#039;ni population. Among the few survivors was Gehn, the son of a D&#039;ni man and a native Earth woman. Gehn&#039;s son, Atrus, is one of the central characters in the games, responsible for the linking books that guide the nameless protagonist (referred to as &quot;Stranger&quot;) to various Ages, where he has to uncover secrets of the past and undo the wrongs done by some of the members of Atrus&#039; family.
