  "s_synopsis": "Silent Hill is a series of primarily survival horror games. Most of the games are not directly connected to each other story-wise, but all take place in the fictional town of Silent Hill and its&#039; environs. This seemingly ordinary, quiet North American town exists in three different dimensions, one being our normal reality, and the other two monster-infested realms that owe their existence to the town&#039;s mysterious past. In one of these two dimensions, Silent Hill is a fog-enveloped, nearly abandoned town overrun by supernatural creatures; in the other, it is an ever more terrifying place full of dark, hellish imagery. The protagonists are typically ordinary people who venture to the town for personal reasons, and must survive and complete their quests."
