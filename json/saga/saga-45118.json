  "s_synopsis": "Legacy of Kain games are set in a dark medieval fantasy world known as Nosgoth. This world has for a long time been a battleground of two powerful races - the Ancient Vampires and the Hylden. Eventually, the vampires were able to overpower the Hylden, banishing them to another dimension. The Pillars of Nosgoth were erected, preventing the Hylden from returning, protected by the Nine Guardians. However, the Hylden are still able to manifest themselves physically in Nosgoth by possessing other creatures. As the power of the Pillars is weakening, the Hylden are trying to manipulate the inhabitants of Nosgoth into opening the gate to their world."
