  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Oddworld&quot; is a fictional universe and a series of games set in it. Most Oddworld games combine platforming gameplay with puzzle-solving. &quot;Oddworld - Stranger&#039;s Wrath&quot; (2005) is often considered a spin-off, since it is more oriented towards shooting gameplay and also has setting-related differences. However, all Oddworld games are united by the common lore of their fictional world.\r\n\r\nOddworld is a planet populated by various races, some humanoid, some resembling animals. The main continent is called Mudos; the most prominently represented race in the games are the Mudokons; the main protagonist of most Oddworld games, Abe, belongs to that race. Among the frequently appearing races are Sligs, Slogs, Paramites, Gabbits, Vykkers, and others - all of various degrees of intelligence and friendliness. One of the main conflicts depicted in the games is that between the Mudokons and the power-hungry, corporate Glukkons; the goal of Abe and other protagonists is usually to free enslaved Mudokons from the clutches of Glukkon leaders and their assistants.
