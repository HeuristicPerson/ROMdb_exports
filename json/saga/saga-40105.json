  "s_synopsis": "Star Ocean is a series of predominantly sci-fi-themed (with medieval fantasy elements) Japanese role-playing games developed by tri-Ace. The games are set in the same universe but are usually not directly related to each other story-wise and feature different casts of playable characters. Although structurally they are traditional Japanese-style RPGs with largely linear progression and simple character-building mechanics, Star Ocean games feature action-based combat similar to that of Tales games. Some of the designers of Tales of Phantasia also worked on the first Star Ocean (1996), which was considered its spiritual follower. ",
