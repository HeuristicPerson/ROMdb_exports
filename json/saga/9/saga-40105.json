  "s_synopsis": "Star Ocean is a series of predominantly sci-fi-themed (with medieval fantasy elements) Japanese role-playing games developed by tri-Ace. The games are set in the same universe but are usually not directly related to each other story-wise and feature different casts of playable characters. Although structurally they are traditional Japanese-style RPGs with largely linear progression and simple character-building mechanics, Star Ocean games feature action-based combat similar to that of Tales games. Some of the designers of Tales of Phantasia also worked on the first Star Ocean (1996), which was considered its spiritual follower. "
