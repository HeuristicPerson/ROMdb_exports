  "s_synopsis": "Gradius is a series of futuristic scrolling shoot-&#039;em-ups which take place in outer space. One of the hallmarks of this series is the power meter. The power meter is typically a bar that highlights selectable options (weapons, shields, etc.) as power-ups are collected. The more power-ups collected, the more powers that are selectable. Players can hold off selecting a power until the one they want becomes available. If a power is selected again for a second or third time, it becomes even more effective. This meter allows the player to customize their spaceships powers to a degree."
