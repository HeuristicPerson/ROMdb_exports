  "s_synopsis": "The games in the series are not directly connected to each other plot-wise, and don&#039;t have any chronological continuity. However, in each Breath of Fire game, the two main characters are invariably called Ryu (Japanese for &quot;dragon&quot;) and Nina. These characters may have different personalities and their common story is different each time, though Ryu always possesses the ability to transform into a dragon, and Nina is always a young girl with wings. Breath of Fire games are usually set in medieval fantasy worlds with technological elements."
