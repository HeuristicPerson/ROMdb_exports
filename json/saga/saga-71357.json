  "s_synopsis": "Lands of Lore is a series of role-playing games that take place in a fantasy world known simply as The Lands. It is populated by many races, the main ones being Humans, Huline, Dracoids, and Thomgog. The most civilized realm of The Lands is known as Gladstone. Individual installments have different protagonists but contain a shared background story involving supernatural beings and recurrent characters. The first game, The Throne of Chaos (1993), was conceived as a lighter, less statistics-heavy variant of first-person RPGs of the time (such as Westwood&#039;s own Eye of the Beholder series). Subsequent entries moved on to action-based combat in a 3D world.\r\n",
