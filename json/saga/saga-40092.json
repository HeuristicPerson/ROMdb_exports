  "s_synopsis": "Series of puzzle platformers starring the three Vikings, Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout. The vikings keep getting kidnapped by the alien emperor Tomator, and have to find their way home again (hence why they are referred to as the lost vikings). Since each viking has a unique ability, they have to work together as a team to overcome level obstacles. The second game in the series introduced two new playable characters, Fang the Werewolf and Scorch the Dragon."
