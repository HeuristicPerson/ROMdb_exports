  "s_synopsis": "&quot;Earthbound&quot; is a series of role-playing games distinguished by its often unorthodox sense of humor, and by its somewhat unusual modern-day setting. Though the games in the series are set in differently named worlds, they bear resemblance to modern-day countries, in particular North America. Despite the realistic setting, the games contain many supernatural and sci-fi elements such as alien races, time travel, etc. The main characters are different in each game, but the player-controlled party of protagonists always consists of children. Recurrent characters include Giygas, the mastermind of an alien race bent on world domination, who is the main antagonist of the first two games, and a few others. Despite their serious premises, the stories contain elements of parody and satire, many humorous situations and conversations, and popular culture references. ",
