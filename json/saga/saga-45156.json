The background story of the series includes legends from thousand years ago, when an evil being called Zophar corrupted the hearts of Blue Star&#039;s inhabitants, turning them into monsters. The benevolent goddess Althena rescued the survivors; since its was impossible to restore life on Blue Star, she transported them onto the moon, magically turning it into a planet suitable for living. Four dragons guard this world, and heroes called the Dragonmasters protect it from danger.",
