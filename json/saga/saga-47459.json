Though its geography and some of its stylistic elements are different in every game, Filgaia tends to resemble a mixture of traditional medieval fantasy with American Wild West and steampunk elements. There is no overarching story in the series, though it does feature recurrent lore, fictional races, and gameplay elements.\r\n",
