  "s_synopsis": "Legend of Zelda (often referred to as simply Zelda) is a series of games by Nintendo that traditionally combine action-based gameplay with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. The games are set in a magical, medieval fantasy-like land of Hyrule, and for the most part feature at least three recurrent characters: the protagonist, a young boy named Link; the titular princess Zelda, whose rescue is usually the goal of the game; and the antagonist, an evil magician known as Ganon or Ganondorf.
