  "s_synopsis": "A series of games starring the starfish prince, Starfy (Stafi), and in later games, his pink sister, Starly (Stapi). Along for the ride is the mentor clam, Moe (Kyorosuke), who provides hints and story progression. As Starfy and Starly are starfish, a lot of the game takes place underwater, and swimming around is much easier than in most platform games."
