  "s_synopsis": "Series of comedy adventure games set in fictional 18th century-like Caribbean Islands, telling the story of the young wannabe-pirate Guybrush Threepwood. The series was originally envisioned as a trilogy by the main designer Ron Gilbert, but he only completed the first two games; the third and the fourth were made without his participation. The latter signified the conclusion of the original series, being the last one developed by LucasArts."
